    "**Question:** There are `n` piles of bananas, the ith pile has `piles[i]` bananas and koko is given an eating time `h` in hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find out the slowest eating speed `k` for koko, such that she can eat all the piles of bananas within the given `h` hours, on the condition that if she finishes all the bananas in a pile then she will not eat anymore bananas for that hour. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example for explanantion of the eating condition, if the eating speed is 5 bananas per hour, and she has only 2 bananas in a pile, she will eat those 2 bananas but she won't move onto the next pile to eat more bananas in that hour, even though she had the capacity of eating 5 (max bananas/hour) - 2 (bananas she ate in that hour) = 3 more bananas during that hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we ask ourselves what could be the maximum eating speed for koko to eat all the piles of bananas and when does that happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The maximum eating speed for koko will be the heighest number of bananas of all the given piles.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - It happens when the number of piles of bananas `n` is equal to the given hours `h` to eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    piles = [11, 23, 30, 15]  \n",
    "    h = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "    The maximum eating speed would be 30 in this case, which is the heighest number of bananas of all the piles.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Since the given hours _h_ to eat is `4` which is equal to the number of piles of bananas _n_ which is also `4`, which implies every pile must be eaten in exactly 1 hour, so the eating speed must be the heighest number of bananas of all the piles that is `30`. If we consider any eating speed less than that then the pile with the `30` bananas cannot be finished in one hour, hence can't finish all the piles within `4` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. So if the number of piles of bananas `n` is equal to the given hours `h` to eat then simply return the heighest number of banana of all the piles as the minimum eating speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now lets ask ourselves what could be the minimum eating speed, ignoring the condition that she can't eat anymore if she has already finished eating a pile of bananas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Like any other distance, speed and time question we are given:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Distance = total number of bananas of all the piles.  \n",
    "    - Time = the given `h` hours to eat.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ==> Speed = (total number of bananas of all the piles) / (the given `h` hours to eat).  \n",
    "\n",
    "    > There can be instances where speed equals to a floating number, like 3.7 bananas per hour, there isn't any possibility of having a 0.7 banana to eat, so we round up the calculated speed to the nearest integer like for the taken example of 3.7 it will be rounded up to 4 bananas per hour.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now that we know the lower time bound (calculated in step 1) and the upper time bound (calculated in step 3) range. We use two pointers left and right initialized to 0 and (upper time bound + 1) including the upper time bound using binary search to find the slowest eating time with the given condition.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    We also initialize the answer slowest eating speed = upper time bound.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. While left <= right, \n",
    "\n",
    "    - calculate the mid time.  \n",

    "**Question:** Given an array of unique integers of length `n` sorted in ascending order, is rotated between 1 and n times. Return the minimum element of this array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The given array is in ascending order, which means before rotating the array the minimum element was at index 0. Now when the array is rotated these are the following key insights about the new rotated array.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the array is rotated less than `n` times, then the first element of the array must be greater than the last element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After rotation the array is divided into two parts of sorted array.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. The second sorted part will have the minimum element of the entire array as it is a point at which the array is rotated.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. The second sorted part will conatin the elements smaller than the first sorted part.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Code Explanation:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: The idea is to find the starting and ending index of the second sorted part of the array and once we find the second sorted part our answer will directly be the element at the starting index of this part as it is the minimum element in the entire array.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initially set the `left` and `right` to the 0<sup>th</sup> index and (N-1)<sup>th</sup> index respectively.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. We always know that no matter how many times we rotate the array, effect is that the second sorted part gets pushed to the right. So the ending index of the second sorted part is always the last index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. So the `right` pointer is already set at the correct position, we only need to find the starting index of the second sorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. While the element at `left` is greater than the element at `right`\n",
    "    - If True, this indicates that the `left` pointer is pointing at an element in the first sorted part.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "    - Else, the `left` pointer is pointing at an element in the second sorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We then calculate the `mid` index, and if the element at mid index is greater than the element at the `right` index:-\n",
    "    - If True, it indicates that `mid` pointer is in the first sorted part range which implies the integers on the left side of the `mid` index are also greater than the element at the `right` index. So we can discard them by moving the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Else, it indicates that the calculated `mid` pointer is in the range of the second sorted part, but we can't be sure that it is the starting index of the second sorted part it could be that this mid index is somewhere between the range of second sorted part. So we narrow down the search range for the starting index by moving the `right` to the `mid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. At last when the loop condition occurs that the element at `left` is now smaller than the element at `right`. We exit the loop and now the element at index `left` is the minimum element in the entire array.\n",
