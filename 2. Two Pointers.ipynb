    "\n",
    "Now, this again can be seen as Two Sum problem where we need to find a pair of integers whose sum should be equal to the negative of the <ins>target</ins> `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>We will now sort the input array and use the two pointer approach to solve this.</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why sorting and two pointer approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    We use sorting and two pointer approach as here we also need to deal with the possible duplicate triplets that might be included in our solution list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <ins>How sorting helps avoiding duplicate triplets?</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example we have an input array [-3, 3, 4, -3, 1, 2]  \n",
    "\n",
    "    we consider -3 from index 0 as our target `z` and using hash-map and iterating through the array we can find a pair (1, 2) which sums up to negative of -3 which is 3. Giving us triplet (-3, 1, 2).  \n",
    "\n",
    "    But then again we encounter -3 at index 3, which will again result us with the triplet (-3, 1, 2) which is a duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now with the sorted the array [-3, -3, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Considering -3 at index 0 to be the target `z` we use the two pointer on the rest of the array and get the solution triplet (-3, 1, 2) as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "    But now we can easily skip for the next -3 at index 1, as it is the same as the previous target -3 at index 0, which will give us the same triplet (-3, 1, 2) as duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We sort the input array and traverse it considering each element as our target `z` and try to find a pair that adds up to negative of `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We check if the target `z` is a positive integer > 0, then we just break out of the traversing, as the array is sorted there will be no negative elements in the array on right to cancel out the positive integer to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then we check if a previous target exists by checking if it is **not** the 0<sup>th</sup> index (first element) if so, we then check if the previous target and the current one are equal? If true, we simply skip the iteration and move to next target.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now we use the two pointer approach and find a of pair of integers whose sum is equal to the negative of target, if we find one, we simply append the triplet to the answer list. And also increment the left pointer, trying to find other possible triplets with the current target.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    But even after moving the left pointer if we see the same previous left index integer from which we just made a triplet and added to our solution, <ins>then we keep incrementing the left pointer unitl we find a different integer</ins>, as we haven't changed the target integer as well as the right pointer integer and if the left pointer integers also remains the same after incrementing then it will generate a duplicate triplet.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now as normally when the sum less than the `-target` we increment the left pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. And when the sum is greater than the `-target` we decreament the right pointer.\n",
    "\n",
