    "    \n",
    "    <ins>How sorting helps avoiding duplicate triplets?</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example we have an input array [-3, 3, 4, -3, 1, 2]  \n",
    "\n",
    "    we consider -3 from index 0 as our target `z` and using hash-map and iterating through the array we can find a pair (1, 2) which sums up to negative of -3 which is 3. Giving us triplet (-3, 1, 2).  \n",
    "\n",
    "    But then again we encounter -3 at index 3, which will again result us with the triplet (-3, 1, 2) which is a duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now with the sorted the array [-3, -3, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Considering -3 at index 0 to be the target `z` we use the two pointer on the rest of the array and get the solution triplet (-3, 1, 2) as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "    But now we can easily skip for the next -3 at index 1, as it is the same as the previous target -3 at index 0, which will give us the same triplet (-3, 1, 2) as duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We sort the input array and traverse it considering each element as our target `z` and try to find a pair that adds up to negative of `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We check if the target `z` is a positive integer > 0, then we just break out of the traversing, as the array is sorted there will be no negative elements in the array on right to cancel out the positive integer to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then we check if a previous target exists by checking if it is **not** the 0<sup>th</sup> index (first element) if so, we then check if the previous target and the current one are equal? If true, we simply skip the iteration and move to next target.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now we use the two pointer approach and find a of pair of integers whose sum is equal to the negative of target, if we find one, we simply append the triplet to the answer list. And also increment the left pointer, trying to find other possible triplets with the current target.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    But even after moving the left pointer if we see the same previous left index integer from which we just made a triplet and added to our solution, <ins>then we keep incrementing the left pointer unitl we find a different integer</ins>, as we haven't changed the target integer as well as the right pointer integer and if the left pointer integers also remains the same after incrementing then it will generate a duplicate triplet.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now as normally when the sum less than the `-target` we increment the left pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. And when the sum is greater than the `-target` we decreament the right pointer.\n",
    "\n",

    "- <ins>How the water gets trapped?</ins>  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - The water can only be trapped at the given position `i` when there are two vertical blocks on the left and the right of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> position, both long enough to prevent the water from flowing out. They need not be adjacent to the current position `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <ins>How much water gets trapped at a given position?</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The amount of water trapped at a given position is depends on the mimimum value of the heighest block to the left of the given position and the heighest block to the right of the given position.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Then from the minimum height subtract the height of current block at the given position to the get the amount of water trapped on top of the current block.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Multiply the difference with the width of the block to get the amount of water. Here in our case witdth is always `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Water trapped at current block = (min(heighest block to the left, heighest block to the right) - height of the current block at given position) x the width of the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As we will traverse the array anyway to find the water trapped at all indicies. So to get the heighest block to the left of any given index, we can simply keep track of a variable, and update to the heighest block encountered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For finding the heighest block to the right of any given index we create an array of length of the input array call it `right_max_heights` and it's each `ith` element will be the value of the heighest block to the right of the `ith` position in the input array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Traversing the input array from the right to left and also fill the `right_max_heights` in the same order, each element with the heighest block value to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now we traverse the input array and keep track of the heighest left block value in `left_max` and the heighest right block from `right_max_heights[i]`, get minimum of the two and subtract the current `ith` block height value to get the water trapped at the ith index. If the calculated value is negative we don't add it to `total_water`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Atlast, return the `total_water`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time: O(n)  \n",
    "    Space: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce the space complexicity, we need to somehow get rid of the `right_max_heights` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we use the Two Pointer approach:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create the left and right pointers at 0th and (N-1)th index respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We then have two variables tracking the left heighest block value and the right heighest block value, initialized to the first element and the last element respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Trapping rain water](assets/trapping_rain_water.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Understanding the key concept:` Refer the image above, initially our left max will be 1 from the 0'th index and the right max will be 1 from the 10th index. So here the left max value is less or equal to the right max value, whereas the right max value may not be the correct right max value since we can see the heighest right max value from 0th index is 3 at the 6th index.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > The key insight is that it doesn't affect our calculation even with the correct right max value, we will only care about the minimum of the left and right max values which is the left max for the above example. This is because the the water level is limited by the shorter of the two blocks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > So we keep incrementing the left pointer to calculate the water and keep using the right max value for comparing until left max becomes greater than the right max value. So even with a greater right max value, it won't change our calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Similarly when the left max value is or becomes greater than the right max value. We keep decrementing the right pointer to calculate the water  and keep using the left max value for comparing unitl the right max value becomes greater than tthe left max value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. While left < right, we check if the left max is less or equal to the right max:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If True, we take left max as reference and we keep incrementing and calculating water at each left index using left max, until we find a left max greater than right max. Then we update the left max to the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Else, we take right max as reference and we keep decrementing and calculating water at each right index using right max, until we find a right max greater than left max. Then we update the right max to the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Atlast, return the calculated `total_water`"
