    "    - If the decreasing order continues till the end of the array then the number of days to wait to get a higher temperature of that entire subsequence will be 0, as `temperatures[i] > temperatures[i+1]`. We never see a temperature ahead that is greater than the current temperature.\n",

    "    - If we come across an index `j` where `temperatures[j]` breaks the decreasing order pattern of the subsequence. We then trace back the previous temperature values one by one, `temperatures[j-1], temperatures[j-2], ...., temperatures[j-C]` checking if the `temperature[j]` is the first temperature greater than `temperature[j-C]` encountered yet.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** There are `n` cars given at a position from starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, where position[i] is the starting mile of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car in miles per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.\n",
    "\n",
    "A car fleet is a car or cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the minimum speed of any car in the fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile target, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Key Insights from the question are as follows:-</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A car behind another car can catch up to the car ahead if and only if the speed of car behind speed is greater than that of the one ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implying the 1st insight further, we can say that if the car behind reaches the `target` destination before the car ahead, in other words if the time taken by the car behind is less than the time taken by the car ahead to reach the target destination, which implies the car behind must have caught up and crossed the car ahead reaching the destination before the car which was ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. According to question the faster car behind can't cross the car ahead, instead it creates a fleet by matching the speed of the slower car.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we zip the two arrays position and speed, creating a list of tuples of position and speed of each ith car.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We then sort the zipped array based on the position of cars, by doing so we can be sure that the cars which is behind the some other car can actually have a chance of creating a fleet with the one ahead. For example, only a car at position 5 will have a chance of creating a fleet with the car at position 8, not the other way around. So by sorting cars by their position we the get cars in order of which they have a chance of creating a fleet with the ones ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now we start from the end of the sorted array, and push the time taken by the ith car to the stack. We then check if the new recently pushed time(time taken by the car behind) is less than or equal to the previous stack top(time taken by the car ahead), if true that means that they create a fleet, so we pop the recently pushed time from the stack and we only keep the slower car's time taken, as the faster car moves with the speed of the slower car after creating a fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <ins>Why did we start from _the end_ of the sorted array?</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider an example, Three cars A, B and C starting from position 0, 5, 8 moving with a speed of 5, 10 and 1  units respectively reaching a target destination of 10. As you see they are in taken in sorted order by position. So if we start checking for fleets from the beginning from the sorted array, we take the cars A and B and compare the time taken by them to reach their destination which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time taken by car A = (target-pos)/speed = (10-0)/5 = **2 units**.  \n",
    "    Time taken by car B = (target-pos)/speed = (10-5)/10 = **0.5 units**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We see that the car A which is behind the car B is taking more time than the car B, which means the car A can never catch up to the car B during the journey. So we conclude that the car A and car B will have their own sparate fleets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Moving on to car B and car C, we calculate their time to complete the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time taken by car B = **0.5 units** form our previous calculation.  \n",
    "    Time taken by car C = (target-pos)/speed = (10-8)/2 = 2/1 = **2 units**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We see that the car B which is behind the car C  and car B is taking less time than the car C, which means that car B will reach the target before the car C, which implies car B must catch up to car C at some point in middle. So the car B will make a fleet with car C and its speed will get reduced to the speed of car C which is `1` units.\n",
    "\n",
    "    But now if we look at the car A and the car fleet of car B and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The time taken by A is now <ins>equal</ins> to the taken by the fleet of B and C, which means the car A can now catch up to the fleet of B and C and create a single fleet of three cars A, B and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is because the speed of car B got reduced to 1 and since the car A behind has a speed of 5 units will eventually catch up to the fleet. So we made the wrong conclusion that the car A couldn't catch up to car B, because the speed of car B changed and so did the time taking to reach the target, and didn't know the final constant speed of the car B before hand, and hence we couldn't make the right conclusion of creating a fleet of A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <ins>Conclusion:</ins>\n",
    "    This happened because we started from the beginning of the sorted array instead if we start checking and creating fleets from the end of array we would be finalizing the speed and the time taken for the cars which are behind the current fleets for comparing their time with the fleets ahead and hence accurately determining the fleet of the cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Return the size of the stack which will be the number of fleets reaching the destination.\n"

    "**Question:** Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Largest Rectangle Example](assets/largest%20histogram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]  \n",
    "Output: 10  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "\n",
    "`Key Insights:` \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each bar in the histogram is a rectangle with the given height and the width of 1. From the example we can see each ith bar has a given height and a width of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The height of the rectangle is fixed by the given height of the bar. However, the width of the rectangle can be extended towards the right and the left as long as the bars to the right and left are greater than the ith bar height.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    From the example above we can see that the width of the bar at index 4 can be extended to the right by 1 as the bar at index 5 is having a greater height that is 3 compared to 2, but can't extend further as index 6 where the height is 0. As for the extention of width to the left, we can extend the width by 2, as the height of the two consecutive bars towards the left are greater than 2 till the index 2, and as height of bar at index 1 is 1, which is less than 2 so we can't extend any further to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hence, the rectangle created from the height of bar at index 4, will have the given height of 4 and for the  width we'll have 2 from the left of the bar and 1 from the right of the bar and another 1 from the current bar itself, so a total width of 4. Therefore the area of the rectangle from the 4th index bar will be 2 x 4 = 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the height of the bars are in strict increasing order, there will be no extension of width to the left, as the very adjacent left bar will be having a height less than the we are conserned with. As for the extention to the right we can extend the width of each bar to the right until we encounter a bar which breaks this strict increasing pattern of heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the key insights we can safely conclude that the maximum area of rectangle in the histogram will be equal to  the maximum of the area of each rectangle of the given ith height, times, the maximum width we can get by extending to the left and to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we are going to use a stack in order to tackle this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to push a tuple of two elements onto the stack which will be;\n",
    "    (start_width_index, height_of_bar) for each bar in the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. While traversing each bar, we first initailize the *start_width_index* for that bar to the current bar's index.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If stack is empty or the current bar height is greater than the height of the bar from the stack top (basically if the bars are in increasing order of heights), we keep pushing the tuple for each bar as:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    starting_width_index  =  initially the index of the current bar.\n",
    "    height_of_bar  =  simply the height of the current bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If we encounter a bar which breaks the increasing order pattern, we stop pushing tuples to the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now we know that the stack top bar's width cannot be extended any further to the right as we encountered a bar with smaller height, so we pop the stack top bar and calculate the area of rectangle it can create.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In order to calculate the area we need the dimensions for this rectangle:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    We pop the stack top tuple and get the `start_width_index` and the `height_of_bar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We need to calculate 2 details,\n",
    "\n",
    "        - the height of the rectangle.\n",
    "        - the maximum possible width of this rectangle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - We can easily get the height from the stack top we just popped.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The maximum width possible will be  =  smaller bar index we just encountered - *start_width_index* from the stack top we popped.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We then calculate the area and update the max area if this new area is greater than the current max area.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Update the *start_width_index* of the smaller bar to the *start_width_index* of the bar we just popped from stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    **IMPORTANT**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The reason why we update the *start_width_index* for the smaller bar which was initially set to the smaller bar's index itself, is because the the *start_width_index* actually tells, upto which index the width of this bar can be extended to the left. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Since we know from the insights, the extension of the width to the left or the right of the a bar, is simply equal to the number of bars of greater height to the left or right of this bar. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    And since the smaller bar's height is less than the stack top bar's height and if this *start_width_index* tells there are bars that are greater than this stack top bar's height to its left upto the *start_width_index* that means this smaller bar's width can now be extented to left till this stack top bar's *start_width_index*.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When stack becomes empty or the height of the stack top's bar is now less than the smaller bar's height. We push the smaller bar's tuple (*start_width_index*, *height_of_bar*).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once we finished traversing the array, there maybe a case where the height of the bars were in increasing order so we just kept pushing onto the stack and didn't get the chance to calculate the area, as the area is only calculated when you encounter a bar's height smaller than the stack top bar's height.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. So we can either do one of the two things:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Run a loop that while the stack is not empty pop the elements and calculate the area as in step 4, just the smaller bar index value will the length of the input array of heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Append a 0 to the end of the input array of heights, as this will ensure that the pattern of increasing order of heights break and the area gets calculated for all the values in the stack. (In the code solution this way is implemented).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Return the maximum result."
