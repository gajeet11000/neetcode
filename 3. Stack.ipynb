If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.\n",

    "    - If the decreasing order continues till the end of the array then the number of days to wait to get a higher temperature of that entire subsequence will be 0, as `temperatures[i] > temperatures[i+1]`. We never see a temperature ahead that is greater than the current temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If we come across an index `j` where `temperatures[j]` breaks the decreasing order pattern of the subsequence. We then trace back the previous temperature values one by one, `temperatures[j-1], temperatures[j-2], ...., temperatures[j-C]` checking if the `temperature[j]` is the first temperature greater than `temperature[j-C]` encountered yet.\n",

    "        If so, that means the `answer[j-C] = j-(j-C) = C` which is the difference between the indicies of two temperatures, basically the number of days to wait since the `temperatures[j-C]` to get a higher temperature `temperatures[j]`. We stop tracing back the previous temperatures until we find a `temperature[j-C]` > `temperatures[j]`.\n",

    "1. We traverse the input array and utilize a stack to implement the <ins>key insight 2</ins> to check if the current `temperature[i]` is greater than the `temperature[x]` stored previously on the stack top, if so, we save `answer[x] = i-x` and <ins>pop the stack top temperature</ins> since we calculated the answer for it just now we repeat this step until the stack top `temperature[x] > current temperature[i]` or the stack goes empty.\n",
