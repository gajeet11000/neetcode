If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.\n",

    "    - If the decreasing order continues till the end of the array then the number of days to wait to get a higher temperature of that entire subsequence will be 0, as `temperatures[i] > temperatures[i+1]`. We never see a temperature ahead that is greater than the current temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If we come across an index `j` where `temperatures[j]` breaks the decreasing order pattern of the subsequence. We then trace back the previous temperature values one by one, `temperatures[j-1], temperatures[j-2], ...., temperatures[j-C]` checking if the `temperature[j]` is the first temperature greater than `temperature[j-C]` encountered yet.\n",

    "1.

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** There are `n` cars given at a position from starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, where position[i] is the starting mile of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car in miles per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.\n",
    "\n",
    "A car fleet is a car or cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the minimum speed of any car in the fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile target, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Key Insights from the question are as follows:-</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A car behind another car can catch up to the car ahead if and only if the speed of car behind speed is greater than that of the one ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implying the 1st insight further, we can say that if the car behind reaches the `target` destination before the car ahead, in other words if the time taken by the car behind is less than the time taken by the car ahead to reach the target destination, which implies the car behind must have caught up and crossed the car ahead reaching the destination before the car which was ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. According to question the faster car behind can't cross the car ahead, instead it creates a fleet by matching the speed of the slower car.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we zip the two arrays position and speed, creating a list of tuples of position and speed of each ith car.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We then sort the zipped array based on the position of cars, by doing so we can be sure that the cars which is behind the some other car can actually have a chance of creating a fleet with the one ahead. For example, only a car at position 5 will have a chance of creating a fleet with the car at position 8, not the other way around. So by sorting cars by their position we the get cars in order of which they have a chance of creating a fleet with the ones ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now we start from the end of the sorted array, and push the time taken by the ith car to the stack. We then check if the new recently pushed time(time taken by the car behind) is less than or equal to the previous stack top(time taken by the car ahead), if true that means that they create a fleet, so we pop the recently pushed time from the stack and we only keep the slower car's time taken, as the faster car moves with the speed of the slower car after creating a fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <ins>Why did we start from _the end_ of the sorted array?</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider an example, Three cars A, B and C starting from position 0, 5, 8 moving with a speed of 5, 10 and 1  units respectively reaching a target destination of 10. As you see they are in taken in sorted order by position. So if we start checking for fleets from the beginning from the sorted array, we take the cars A and B and compare the time taken by them to reach their destination which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time taken by car A = (target-pos)/speed = (10-0)/5 = **2 units**.  \n",
    "    Time taken by car B = (target-pos)/speed = (10-5)/10 = **0.5 units**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We see that the car A which is behind the car B is taking more time than the car B, which means the car A can never catch up to the car B during the journey. So we conclude that the car A and car B will have their own sparate fleets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Moving on to car B and car C, we calculate their time to complete the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time taken by car B = **0.5 units** form our previous calculation.  \n",
    "    Time taken by car C = (target-pos)/speed = (10-8)/2 = 2/1 = **2 units**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We see that the car B which is behind the car C  and car B is taking less time than the car C, which means that car B will reach the target before the car C, which implies car B must catch up to car C at some point in middle. So the car B will make a fleet with car C and its speed will get reduced to the speed of car C which is `1` units.\n",
    "\n",
    "    But now if we look at the car A and the car fleet of car B and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The time taken by A is now <ins>equal</ins> to the taken by the fleet of B and C, which means the car A can now catch up to the fleet of B and C and create a single fleet of three cars A, B and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is because the speed of car B got reduced to 1 and since the car A behind has a speed of 5 units will eventually catch up to the fleet. So we made the wrong conclusion that the car A couldn't catch up to car B, because the speed of car B changed and so did the time taking to reach the target, and didn't know the final constant speed of the car B before hand, and hence we couldn't make the right conclusion of creating a fleet of A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <ins>Conclusion:</ins>\n",
    "    This happened because we started from the beginning of the sorted array instead if we start checking and creating fleets from the end of array we would be finalizing the speed and the time taken for the cars which are behind the current fleets for comparing their time with the fleets ahead and hence accurately determining the fleet of the cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Return the size of the stack which will be the number of fleets reaching the destination.\n"
